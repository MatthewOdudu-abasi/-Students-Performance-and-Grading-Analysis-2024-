ðŸŽ“ Students Performance & Grading Analysis Report.

ðŸ“Š Project Summary

This analytical report explores the Students Grading Dataset sourced from Kaggle. The project examines factors influencing academic performance, including study habits, sleep hours, attendance, and demographics. Built in Microsoft Excel using Pivot Charts and Tables, it visualizes key trends and patterns to identify what drives higher academic scores.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Explore the relationship between study hours, sleep, and grades.

Understand demographic effects (age, gender) on academic performance.

Compare department-level grading patterns.

Identify high-performing students and insights for improvement.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

Best Performing Student (ID): S1310 â€“ 99.98%

Top Performing Department: CS (75.57 avg score)

Best Students by Age Group: Age 22

Sleep Hours Impact: 7â€“8 hours = highest performance (~84.3%)

Study Hours Impact: 21â€“30 hrs/week = best average grade

Grade A Attendance Rate: Highest at 86.2%

âœ… Recommendations

Encourage 7â€“8 hours of sleep per night to improve scores.

Promote consistent study schedules of 21â€“30 hrs/week.

Departments should review grading consistency, especially in Mathematics and Business.

Provide support for lower-performing age groups (18â€“21).

Track attendance closelyâ€”Grade A students have significantly higher attendance.

Further analyze students performing below average despite strong attendance or study habits.
